        <p>Bali, which one of the major cities in Indonesia, is locate at the westernmost part of the country. It was established in 1958. It's main religion is muslim. They are a very warm and welcoming tribe of people. My time there was spent enjoying the people, food, weather and sceneries. I spent a lot of my time connecting with people from all walks of life. I recommend any and everyone to travel there is they can. It was a life changing experience.</p>

            <p>Being in Canggu, you really got to meet a lot of people, eat amazing foods and travel around a party freely. I'd say Canggu is famous for the amazing beaches, to hangout and sufers, and their food.</p><br>
           <p>Seminyak, was one of the main cities I was more excited about. I'm not sure if it was the fod or just the people but everyone was so welcoming and nice. It made my time there feel even more special.</p>

           <p>Nusa Lembongan, took my heart completely. The island was is so small, so a lot of the people no matter how far know each other. It was like a small, but big community, I was able to site see, snorkel and meet some wonderful travelers there myself.</p>
